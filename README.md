# OpenSim.WebRTC
 
This is out on GitHub in the hopes of others helping with the project

As you know Vivox is no longer supporting new grids and SecondLife is ending its support for vivox.
Therefor OpenSim will soon be out of luck for Vivox support. Hense why I am making this module.

Sadly I have no idea what im doing xD
